      <h2>Project 1</h2>
      <p>On this project I was the sole programmer. This project was created for a Summer Camp run by the Salvation Army and resulted in about 2-3 hours of administrative work a week being completed in a fraction of the time. 
          Currently this is a WIP as there are plans to further shorten the work time using OCR Technology with a target of performing the work in about 3 minutes.

      <h2>Project 2</h2>
      <p>This was a project done for semester 2 of Web Development. The goal of the project was to create a form with validation
        which I made a custom validation program for. And to pull values from fields to populate new ones.

      <h2>Project 3</h2>
      <p>This was a program created for semester 2 of Web Development with the goal being to create a game of sorts similar to 
        the well known bug smasher. I opted to add a few extra features just to make it a bit harder and add a bit more uniqueness to it.
